Files for the production of a PCB that will be combined with the PocketBeagle and several other components to make a simple digital etch-a-sketch.

EAGLE contains Eagle files such as the library (.lbr), board (.brd), and schematics (.sch) that can be opened in Eagle or other PCB CAM editors. They contain the appropriate documentation for understanding the electronics and components used. This folder also contains the gerber files necessary to produce the board.
MFG contains mechanical diagrams of the top and bottom of the board, as well as a simplfiied mechanical block diagram.

Other files are .pdf 's of the board and electrical schematics, also a Bill of Materials (BOM) .csv

Special notes:
This project is made to work specifically with a PocketBeagle (https://beagleboard.org/pocket) and an Adafruit SPI screen (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1770)
